    <b>Three places to learn surfing</b><br>
    <img src="./images/ket7_13.png" alt="surfing" style="max-width:220px;margin:12px auto;display:block;">
  </div>
  <b>Nosara, Costa Rica</b><br>
  From the centre of the town of Nosara, you can easily walk to several good beaches for beginner surfers. The sea is warm all year round and the weather is beautiful, so you'll be surprised by how quiet the beaches always are. There are many excellent surf teachers around the town, and their prices aren't high. The town's also famous for its wildlife park, where you can see some amazing sea animals.<br><br>
  <b>Agadir, Morocco</b><br>
  The area around Agadir in the south of Morocco is very popular with surfers. Beginners need to go in autumn when the sea is safe and the water is nice and warm. Experienced surfers will enjoy it more in winter when the waves are big and exciting. From the city you can drive to many lovely beaches in less than 20 minutes. The area's well known for having a large number of surf camps. These are comfortable and friendly and don't cost much. Book for at least three days, to make the most of your time.<br><br>
  <b>Inch Marlow, Barbados</b><br>
  A surprising number of people haven't heard that the southern side of the island of Barbados is excellent for beginner surfers. However, Zed Layson, a famous surfer, has a school there at Surfer's Point, which is excellent for those who want to try the sport for the first time. As well as good teachers, there is always a photographer waiting to take a picture of you on your surfboard. In summer it rains a lot, but the water is warm so surfing is still possible.

      <div class="reading-title"><b>My hobby</b></div>
      <div class="reading-subtitle"><i>Fifteen-year-old Zoe Cabello talks about snowboarding</i></div>
      <div class="reading-body" style="margin-top:8px;">
        I first tried snowboarding when I was seven, on a family holiday. My older brother was already a really good snowboarder, and at that age, I always wanted to do everything he did. My dad paid for a lesson, but I didn’t enjoy it at all, and decided never to do it again.<br><br>
        After that, I started doing gymnastics, and I got really good at it. Then, when I was nine, one of my friends had a snowboarding party at an indoor snow centre for her birthday. I wanted to say no because I was scared of hurting myself. However, she really wanted me to go, so I decided to be brave, and said yes.<br><br>
        And actually, this time, I thought snowboarding was amazing! Because of all the gymnastics, I was strong and fit and it wasn’t difficult for me. In just a couple of hours I was able to stay on my feet from the top of the slope to the bottom.<br><br>
        When I was 11, we moved to Italy for nine months because of my father's job. We lived in the north of the country, near the mountains, and I was able to go snowboarding a lot. When we returned home, my friends couldn't believe how good I was.<br><br>
        These days all our family holidays are spent snowboarding. I love everything about it - the fresh air, the views, even the clothes. But more than anything, I love the fact that there's always something new to learn. That's what keeps it interesting for me.
